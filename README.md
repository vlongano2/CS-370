# CS-370
For this project, I had to implement a q-learning algorithm for an AI pirate to try to find treasure before the player does. I was given two main classes of code. One took care of the actual map generation and provided the functions for the pirate to move and interact in the world. The other was responsible for recording the experience and improving the AI for further iterations. The code  I created myself was the actual algorithm or steps that the pirate would take during each iteration of training. This code handled the very start state, as well as states in between start and finish. 

Computer scientist take real world problems and model them in a mathematical way that we can then use computers to quickly solve the problems without human error. This is very important in todays day and age where there are so many people and the data sets we use in order to keep jobs and society running are so large that we need computers to realistically handle these tasks. 

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into fundamental parts. What am I given, what am I trying to get? The steps between these two states are essentially an algorithm and can be solved in steps or iterations. Computer science is all about breaking problems down and solving them in smaller pieces and that is exactly my approach when faced with these situations. 

My ethical responsibilities are to help an organization achieve what they want in a way that abides laws and does not risk the privacy of end users.
